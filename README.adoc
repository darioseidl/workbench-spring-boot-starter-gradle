# Spring Boot Starter Workbench Project utilizing Gradle as Build Tool

This workbench project demonstrates how to setup a Spring Boot Starter and Auto Configuration as a project using Gradle.

It includes the following sub-projects:

* `greet-library`: A sample library that is configured by the Starter and is _mandatory_ for all consumer applications. It is therefore automatically included as a transitive dependency.
* `greet-opt-library`: A sample library that is configured by the Starter and is _optional_ for consumer applications. It has to be explicitly declared as a dependency by the consumer.
* `gradle-workbench-spring-boot-autoconfigure`: The autoconfiguration implementation. It shows how to handle classes that may not be present on the classpath when the consumer is running.
* `gradle-workbench-spring-boot-starter`: The Spring Boot Starter that is declared as a dependency by the consumer and references all mandatory transitive dependencies.
* `sample-application-simple`: A cli Spring Boot application demonstrating the usage of the Starter without using the optional library.
* `sample-application-optional`: A cli Spring Boot application demonstrating the usage of the Starter including the optional library.

## How to build

The libraries, starter and autoconfiguration are build as Gradle multi-project. The sample applications are separate Gradle projects.

The starter project has to be build and published to the local maven repository once before building the sample applications.

### Build the Starter and Libraries

To build the starter, auto-configuration and library projects and publish them to the local maven repository use `./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal`.

### Build and run the Sample Applications

In either the `sample-application-simple` or `sample-application-optional` folder use `./gradlew clean bootRun` to start the application.
